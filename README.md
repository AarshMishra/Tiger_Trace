# Tiger_Trace

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies tigers as 'endangered.' With over half of the world's tiger population residing in India, effective monitoring and accurate counting of these animals are crucial for their conservation. In India, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) are responsible for this vital task. Their current approach involves deploying trap cameras equipped with motion detectors in national parks and tiger reserves. These cameras automatically capture images of tigers as they move through their natural habitat. Biologists and scientists then meticulously analyze these photographs to identify and distinguish individual tigers based on their unique stripe patterns. This method, while reducing direct human-wildlife interaction, is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, often leading to delays in reporting and potential inaccuracies in the tiger population data.

This model is an image classification model utilizing deep learning techniques to identify and distinguish different tigers based on their features and it aims to address the challenges by automating the identification of tigers based on their stripe patterns. By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this model can distinguish between individual tigers with high accuracy. This innovative approach not only streamlines the monitoring process but also reduces human error, providing more reliable data for conservation efforts.
